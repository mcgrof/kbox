# kbox - kernel sandboxing

The goal of this tree is to have a toolbox of mechanisms and ideas on how
to sandbox a kernel. A development tree is used to show the evolution of ideas
behind the concept of kernel sandboxing through different strategies. Each
strategy has a dedicated directory starting with an introduction to the
most basic concept of code retiring in the kernel today, freeing unused
kernel code. The rest of the sections expand on this idea for different
use cases with different code examples and tools.
